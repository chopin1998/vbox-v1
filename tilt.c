//
// This code is from the Autopilot project and implements an
// Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) where the model isn't linear
// functions of the state, but are differentiable functions.
// Note that a matrix of partial derivatives (the Jacobian) is
// computed in the code below.
//
// Original code from: http://www.rotomotion.com/downloads/tilt.c
//
// The original comments from the code have been preserved to
// the extend possible.  Also note that this code is licensed
// under GPL.
//
// Original comments below:
//
// 1 dimensional tilt sensor using a dual axis accelerometer
// and single axis angular rate gyro.  The two sensors are fused
// via a two state Kalman filter, with one state being the angle
// and the other state being the gyro bias.
//
// Gyro bias is automatically tracked by the filter.  This seems
// like magic.
//
// Please note that there are lots of comments in the functions and
// in blocks before the functions.  Kalman filtering is an already complex
// subject, made even more so by extensive hand optimizations to the C code
// that implements the filter.  I've tried to make an effort of explaining
// the optimizations, but feel free to send mail to the mailing list,
// autopilot-devel@lists.sf.net, with questions about this code.
